Bayesian Inference for  Optical Interferometry


Dependencies : numpy, scipy, matplotlib, emcee, oivis, astropy, corner

Get started : 
- The main code is located in /src/binopi
- The example folder contains a jupyter notebook that walks through the generation of synthetic data and the fitting method (which generates files in the same folder)
- For now, all dependencies are installed on the venv that is present in the repo (/venv)
- Reference observations can be found in /refobs
